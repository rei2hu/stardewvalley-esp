### Settings
Settings can be customized through the ingame menu. As you encounter more entities throughout the game, you will have the choice to add a colored label to them.

### Menu
By default, you can open the configuration menu with `k`. It should be pretty straightforward; it allows you to easily pick colors or disable labels. If you change the settings in the middle of a game via the actual file, they can be reloaded with `l`. Hotkeys can be changed in the menu.
